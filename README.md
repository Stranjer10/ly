### Information

I'm sorry if the code looks weird; I'm working only on a phone (I don't have a PC/Laptop) and I'm still a beginner. :)

### Idea

I started searching for lyrics APIs because of this repository: [Spotify Lyrics API by akashrchandran](https://github.com/akashrchandran/spotify-lyrics-api)
